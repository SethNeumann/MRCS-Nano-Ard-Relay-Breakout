A client wanted a simple automation controller to turn many sound animation units on and off
more less randomly.  He had the modules and gotten as far as turning them on and off with Arduino
relays. I discussed the project with contributor Jon Schmidt and created a sketch.  The board simply maps 
the Nanos D2-D3 and A0-A3 to male header pins with power and +5 in the appropriate places.  All you need to do 
make up cables with Dupont type cables (0.100 available for Pololu and many others) in the appropriate sizes.

Power is from a 5V wall wart which powers the Nano and associated relays
